**Simple HTTP Server with Security Headers**
Overview
Welcome to the Simple HTTP Server project! This is a lightweight HTTP server built with Python that serves static files and implements essential security headers to ensure better web security for users.

In today’s digital landscape, web security is crucial, even for simple applications. This project incorporates industry-standard security headers and configurations to protect against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

**Features**
Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Forces secure connections (HTTPS) to the server.
Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Restricts the types of content the server can load.
X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents browsers from interpreting files in unsafe ways.
X-XSS-Protection: Adds protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Referrer-Policy: Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests.
Prevents Directory Listings: Ensures that file listings are not exposed when an index file is missing.
Getting Started
To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow the instructions below.
**
Prerequisites**
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from python.org.
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

1. Copy code
git clone https://github.com/WinWin300/simple-http-server.git
cd simple-http-server
Install any necessary dependencies (if any):

2. Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If there are no dependencies, you can skip this step.)

Usage
Run the server using the following command:

3. Copy code
python3 server.py
The server will start running on http://localhost:8080.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the server. If you have configured HTTPS, use https://localhost:8080 instead.

**Security Features**
This server includes the following headers to enhance security:

Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): Ensures that HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS, providing protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP): Helps mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by restricting which content can be loaded by the browser.

X-Content-Type-Options: Prevents browsers from interpreting files in ways that could lead to attacks.

X-XSS-Protection: Protects against some types of XSS attacks by enabling the browser's built-in protection mechanisms.

Referrer-Policy: Controls how much information the browser sends about the referring page to reduce privacy leaks.

These headers help secure your server and prevent many common web vulnerabilities.
